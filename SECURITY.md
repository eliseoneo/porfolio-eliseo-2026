# Security & Confidentiality

This public repository is a portfolio. It intentionally excludes:
- credentials, tokens, keys, `.env` files
- customer identifiers, internal hostnames/IPs, tenant data
- real production logs or incident artifacts
- production deployment endpoints or access patterns

Where appropriate, demos use synthetic data and sanitized examples.
Private technical walkthroughs or reference implementations can be shared under NDA.
